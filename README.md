# FooGA
FooGA is a program to solve the TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem) using Genetic Algorithms.

It is a Windows executable that runs over Google Maps. 
You set the "salesman" destinations over the map and then you ask the program to calculate the shortest possible route to visit each place once.
